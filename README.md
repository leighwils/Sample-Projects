**Sample Project: Analyzing Borrowersâ€™ Risk of Defaulting** 

The purpose of this project is to prepare a report for a bank's loan division, and specifically to determine if a customer's marital status and number of children correlates to their likelihood to default on a loan. The conclusion will be used to inform how to build credit scores for potential customers.
