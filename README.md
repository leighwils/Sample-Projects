# Description of Sample Projects
This repository contains sample projects that I have completed as part of my Practicum by Yandex Data Science bootcamp.  

**Sample Project: Analyzing Borrowersâ€™ Risk of Defaulting** 

The purpose of this sample project was to prepare a report for a bank's loan division, and specifically to determine if a customer's marital status and number of children correlates to their likelihood to default on a loan. In this scenario, the conclusion would be used to inform how to build credit scores for potential customers.
