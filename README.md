# Description of Sample Projects
This repository contains sample projects using Python that I have completed as part of my Practicum by Yandex Data Science bootcamp.  

**Sample Project: Analyzing Borrowersâ€™ Risk of Defaulting (Focus on Data Preprocessing)** 

The purpose of this sample project was to prepare a report for a bank's loan division, and specifically to determine if a customer's marital status and number of children correlates to their likelihood to default on a loan. In this scenario, the conclusion would be used to inform how to build credit scores for potential customers.

**Sample Project: Analyzing Free Advertisements (Focus on Exploratory Data Analysis)**

The purpose of this sample project was to explore data around hundreds of free advertisements for cars to look at what factors influence car price.  
To achieve this goal, I first processed the data to ensure it was ready for analysis, including looking for and cleaning up missing values and conducting some initial calculations to make sure I could compare the data points accurately to look for correlation. After the data had been cleaned up, I looked at the relationship between the price the vehicle and other characteristics to look at what influences the price.

**Sample Project: Analyzing Phone Plans (Focus on Statistical Data Analysis)**

The purpose of this sample project was to look at two prepaid plans to determine which brings in more revenue to inform the advertising budget. As a first step, I preprocessed the data to ensure the data was ready for analysis. I then conducted statistical analysis to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of each plan's revenue data.

**Sample Project: Analyzing Video Game Sales (Integrated Project)**

The purpose of this sample project was to analyze video game sales to determine what factors influence the success of particular games. After preprocessing the data, I analyzed the data to look at the impact of release year, genre, user ratings and expert ratings on sale performance over time.
