# Description of Sample Projects
This repository contains sample projects that I have completed as part of my Practicum by Yandex Data Science bootcamp.  

**Sample Project: Analyzing Borrowersâ€™ Risk of Defaulting (Focus on Data Preprocessing)** 

The purpose of this sample project was to prepare a report for a bank's loan division, and specifically to determine if a customer's marital status and number of children correlates to their likelihood to default on a loan. In this scenario, the conclusion would be used to inform how to build credit scores for potential customers.

**Sample Project: Analyzing Free Advertisements (Focus on Exploratory Data Analysis)**

The purpose of this sample project was to explore data around hundreds of free advertisements for cars to look at what factors influence car price.  
To achieve this goal, I first processed the data to ensure it was ready for analysis, including looking for and cleaning up missing values and conducting some initial calculations to make sure I could compare the data points accurately to look for correlation. After the data had been cleaned up, I looked at the relationship between the price the vehicle and other characteristics to look at what influences the price.
